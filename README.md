# Cryptocurrency Dashboard

This repository contains the program that I made for Algorithm and Programming Semester 1 Final Project



### Description

I made a cryptocurrency dashboard that can track the top 10 market capitalization cryptocurrencies' price. Also you can compare one cryptocurrency with another, and finally you can see the forecast of every cryptocurrency for 6 months ahead.
